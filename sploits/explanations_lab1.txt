Sploit1:
    * objective:
        Exploit with the use of the strcpy() function in target file.

    * find the address with the use of gdb:
        buf ->> 0x3021fe50
    
    line 27 - 28 && line 36 - 37 :
        ->> put NOP instructions into the buffer, so it can be used as a landing zone 
        (when we try to return address point to the buffer). But in this lab we use hard coded
        address point to the start address of the buf, so here the NOP instructions only used for
        filling the remaining space outside the shellcode.
    
    line 30 - 35:
        ->> put shellcode into the buffer, so when the return address point to the buf, 
        the program will execute the shellcode and spawn a shell.

    line 49 - 53:
        ->> put the buf address into the buffer, and make sure when the target program executes the
        strcpy command, it will overflow the buffer space and for the particular ($rip), it will be 
        replaced by the buf[120] - buf[123]. Notice that this is x86-64 bit architecture, so all the 
        addresses should be 8 byte long. So we also need to add a null byte in the buff so that the overflow
        will not affect the rest 4 byte of the $rip.

    * objective:
        Exploit with the use of the loop iteration in the function foo() in target file.
        since the len is lager than the size of the buf, so we could use that to overflow
        the buffer and overwrite the $rip.

    * find the address with the use of gdb:
        buf ->> 0x3021fd80
        len ->> 0x3021fe88
        i   ->> 0x3021fe8c

    line 48 - 50:
        ->> overwrite the len to 284 so that the overflowed buffer could reach the $rip.

    line 72 - 83:
        ->> overwrite the i to '\x0f' so that the loop will jump over the 4 bytes of 'i'
        and continue assigning NOP instructions until reach the $rip.
        ->> use the environment variable to bypass the null byte and extend 
        the buffer to reach the $rip.
